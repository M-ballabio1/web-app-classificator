# Web-app-classificator

# Welcome to the Medical Doctor Client Web Application!

#### Goal: 
This web application simulates the interaction of a medical doctor client with a Web service API hosted on Google Cloud Run. The API's primary objective is to process the medical images received from the client using a powerful Deep Learning algorithm. It then provides a JSON response containing the probabilities of classification for the image across three classes.

#### User Action: 
As a medical doctor, you can upload an image through the interface, and the API will analyze it to determine the likelihood of belonging to each of the specified classes.

Please note that this is a simulated environment, and the results presented here are for demonstrative purposes only. Enjoy exploring the capabilities of our Deep Learning-based medical image classification system!
